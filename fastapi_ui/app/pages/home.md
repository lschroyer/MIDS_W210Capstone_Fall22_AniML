# Welcome to AniMLs.
## Computer Vision made easy for automated image processing

AniMLs is an easy tool for the rapid creation of computer vision systems for analyzing filtering a large set of raw images down to images of interest

1. <span style="color:black"> **Filter**</span>


    Upload your unfiltered images and we'll auto sort them into similarity groups!

2. <span style="color:black"> **Label**</span>

    From the resulting groups, choose a few sample images that contain the items of interest you want to detect to manually label. Then our algorithm can automatically find these categories in future images you upload.

3. <span style="color:black"> **Train**</span>

    Using your mannualy labeled dataset, we train a custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that will accurately hone in on your objects of interest.

4. <span style="color:black"> **Relax**</span>

    With your model hosted on an API endpoint, simple add images as you need and weâ€™ll do the rest. Relax as your huge datasets are filtered down to items of interest and beautiful analytics are shared.
