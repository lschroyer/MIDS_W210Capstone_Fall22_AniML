1. <span style="color:black"> **Filter**</span>


    Upload your unfiltered images and we'll auto sort them into similarity groups!

2. <span style="color:black"> **Label**</span>

    From the resulting groups, choose a few sample images that contain the items of interest you want to detect to manually label. Then our algorithm can automatically find these categories in future images you upload.

3. <span style="color:black"> **Train**</span>

    Using your mannualy labeled dataset, we train a custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that will accurately hone in on your objects of interest.

4. <span style="color:black"> **Relax**</span>

    With your model hosted on an API endpoint, simple add images as you need and we’ll do the rest. Relax as your huge datasets are filtered down to items of interest and beautiful analytics are shared.
