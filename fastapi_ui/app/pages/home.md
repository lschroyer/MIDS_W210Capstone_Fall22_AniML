1. <span style="color:black"> **Filter, Review, and Download**</span>


    Upload your unfiltered images and we'll auto sort them by if the image contains an object or is empty! You can then review and adjust the filtering model results before saving the images that contain the animals or objects of interest. You can then save all the images that have objects of interest in them. If that's all you need, your done! However, if you'd like our AniML to classify what type of objects are in each non-empty photo, continue on to step 2.

2. <span style="color:black"> **Label and Train**</span>

    From the resulting groups, choose a few sample images that contain the items of interest you want to detect to manually label. Then our algorithm can automatically find these categories in future images you upload.

    Using your mannualy labeled dataset, we train a custom Artificial Intelligence (AI) model that will accurately hone in on your objects of interest.

3. <span style="color:black"> **Classify, Review, and Download**</span>

    With your model hosted on an API endpoint, simple add images as you need and we’ll do the rest. Relax as your huge datasets are filtered down to items of interest and beautiful analytics are shared.

    After any final adjustments that you make the the final model classifications, you can then download the files into folders seperated by object type!
